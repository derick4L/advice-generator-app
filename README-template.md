### What I learned

I learned how to use Web Components to leverage HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while building on my knowledge of component based architecture. By using Web Components, I built several class methods utilizing the 'this' keyword, and even made Fetch API call. My understanding of scope, templates, components and the DOM are highlighted here.
